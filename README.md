There is a files of data base RIS_PRIS in the folder "DataBase", server side of my project. The folder "RIS_PRIS_Kurs" contains files of Windows Forms files - client side of the project. I haven't moved the project yet so that it can be used from any computer, but you can watch the video and the project documentation to familiarize yourself with the project.
You can try to launch the project via RIS_PRIS_Kurs.exe
